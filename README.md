All code by Ken Schiller.

Java code used to solve and generate my node/circuit puzzles.

Main is used to generate large numbers of new puzzles. In its current form, it will print to the console a large number of new 8x8 puzzles. Changing the parameters allows for different ways of generating puzzles. See the comments for more info.

Main2 is used to find the solution(s) to a puzzle entered through the console.
